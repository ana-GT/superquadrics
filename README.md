Superquadrics
=============

* Code to fit superquadrics (specifically superellipsoids to PCL pointclouds)
* Originally written by Alex Ichim.
* Forked since I needed to add documentation to understand what source file does :)

Requirements
-------------
These are the packages I had to install / update:

1. Eigen 3.2 (my machine had 3.0.5 and that did not work)
2. Boost 1.48 (I had 1.46 and that did not work either)
3. PCL 1.7 (be sure to compile with the Boost version above)
4. CERES 1.7 (which required me to install google flags and google log)
